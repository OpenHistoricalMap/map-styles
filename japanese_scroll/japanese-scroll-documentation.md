# Documentation of Japanese Scrool Map Style
This style was created after the Woodblock style, and is inspired by the long-form Japanese scroll maps from ~1500/1600/1700s. In some ways, the longform map emulates the modern mapping scale so much more, because the scrolls gave so much more space for information and data. Of course, the amount of paper isn't the same as global or multiple zoom levels, but the premise of showing more information, and having a different visualization connection to what one sees in real life, on the ground, is why I wanted to make this style.
<br>
Obviously, the map style is limited to a rectangular screen size, and also doesn't have the same capacity to make you feel like you are strolling along a river, the coast, or a trail, but hopefully some of the core aesthetic elements bring this style into clearly being rooted in historical Japanese maps.

Below are the maps from which I pulled inspiration:
- [[Shandong, Zhili, Shengjing hai jiang tu]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822cm.gct00259?r=0.375,0.043,0.25,0.154,0)  Coastal map of Shandong, Zhili, and Shengjing
- [Map of the Sea and Land Routes from Edo to Nagasaki](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_14435_001/?sp=23&r=-0.08,-0.07,1.238,0.761,0), Kyoto : Nishida Shobee, 1672
- [Dai Nihon enkai yochi zenzu](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7960m.gct00032/?sp=16&r=-0.192,0.859,0.973,0.598,0) [Japan, Hokkaido to Kyushu]
- [Song Xian he tu.](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7823s.ct003375/?r=-0.218,-0.052,1.454,0.894,0) Map of the river systems in Song County
- [[Rehe xing gong quan tu]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7824c.ct001844/?r=0.789,0.26,0.25,0.154,0)

## Aesthetic Elements That Made the Map Look Old
### Background Layer (land)

For this style, it made sense to emulate the texture of old, aged paper, as this aesthetic is something we are very used to seeing in old maps. 

## Water (Ocean, lakes)

I was inspired by the above, and created a pattern for water areas across the map that was similar to the above.

## Linework (admin, roads)

Similar to Woodblock, I used  inconsistent/tapering lines to emulate the imperfections of old maps. 

## Symbology (Mountains)

Symbology in old maps always a reason why they look old. Mountains were a consistent theme across japanese maps, so I created these symbols as well.

## Label Design

This felt really important as a few of the maps had this styling. I used block/square halos with red tones were common across various maps. Incorporated reds as well as mustard yellows, as this also was colors used across some of the inpsiration maps

## Data Choices
Like the Woodblock style, this map style intentionally removes quite a bit of OHM data from the map. Older maps had a lot less data in them. If this map were to grow over time and have more data added, there would need to be some consideration of how design elements change to ensure that there is an appropriate hierarchy and balance of contrast.

For now, this style serves to highlight an older map aesthetic, in modern mapping technologies, alongside showing data over time.
