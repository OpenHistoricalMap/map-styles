# Documentation of Rail Style: Where it is today
The below documents the original considerations for the rail style. This style, however, is one that requires some design updates, and I would say is not at all a "final design" because of the likelihood of more data attributes to exist in the future. This style is historical but also must be practical, and unlike the other two style variants, this style requires more data, and also has more need for multi-variant styling of some elements (specifically rail). <br>

## Original Rail Style Inspiration (And references for the future?)

### Main line routes

heavy black lines with white/clear circles (that represented towns) were common across many historical maps. This in itself isn't shocking: Make a clearly visible line, and showcase where the cities and towns are along the routes. The result is a visually distinct aesthetic, however. Given that this occurs often and also globally ( *historical research dependent on what I could find based on language I speak, so noting that I attempted to review globally but limits here). Given this, this aesthetic seems appropriate for "main" line routes.

While this is where the inspiration for the "main" rail lines came from, the OHM community has generally stated that it would be ideal to update this, so I anticipate when there are more data attributes, this styling will change in the future.

### "Other route" aesthetics
Obvious tracks, dashed lines, and other line aesthetics are ones we should use for the upcoming variety of rail that folx are considering adding as more distinguishable tags for a rail specific style, but I wanted to also review historically how some of these presented, as well as gather other options for inspiration. 
<br>
The below lists and shows some examples
<br>
<br>
Thick, dense rail dashes (millipede-esque):

mostly-one-sided dash (I think possible implentation via offset?):

Legend with line varieties (not just rail):

"casing only" route (not the main routes that are bolder here):

And of course, the above isn't including basic line representation, color variances, and normal dashing lines as well (also pictured in these map examples)

## Data and Design Today vs the Future
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52041a80-e350-47ab-a96a-f55162927465)
The above notes what the various rail styling looks like today. Updates have been made since the original style release based on community feedback, but as noted above, there will absolutely be more changes in the future.
<br><br>
Data-wise today, only some places across the globe have visible rail variance. When there are updates to the rail data, this is where there will be a need for more design changes and considerations to be made, especially because this is what the OHM rail community has identified as a space that they want updated (more data, and then updated designs for that new data).
